# LEARN virtual Class Room (vCR) Platform

**vCR** is an online teaching platform for universities and higher education institutions in Sri Lanka. It is built using the free and open-source **BigBlueButton** system and runs on powerful servers hosted by **LEARN**. vCR is ideal for **webinars**, as well as **regular virtual meetings and discussions**.

With vCR, students and teachers can connect live, share content, and learn together in real time.

### Accessing the vCR Platform Off-Campus

The platform must be accessed through the **LEARN Identity Access Federation**. Login credentials are provided by your affiliated institution via its Identity Provider (IdP). Users should always use the credentials issued by their **primary home institution**.

While the platform can be used to teach at multiple LEARN member institutions, **eduID** can be used only if your primary institution is unable to provide valid credentials. If you don’t have an eduID, you can [sign up here](#) to receive one within 48 hours.

The **number of accounts allocated to each institution** is determined by the platform’s capacity and is proportional to the institution’s contribution to LEARN.
