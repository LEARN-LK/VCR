### Accessing the vCR Platform Off-Campus**

The platform must be accessed through the **LEARN Identity Access Federation**. Login credentials are provided by your affiliated institution via its Identity Provider (IdP). Users should always use the credentials issued by their **primary home institution**.

While the platform can be used to teach at multiple LEARN member institutions, **eduID** can be used only if your primary institution is unable to provide valid credentials. If you don’t have an eduID, you can [sign up here](#) to receive one within 48 hours.

The **number of accounts allocated to each institution** is determined by the platform’s capacity and is proportional to the institution’s contribution to LEARN.
