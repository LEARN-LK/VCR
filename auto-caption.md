###  **Step 4: Grant Permission for Speech Recognition**

* Your browser (e.g., Chrome) may prompt you to allow microphone access for speech recognition.
* **Click “Allow”** when asked.
* On some systems (like macOS), you may also need to enable:

  * **System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Microphone**
  * And/or **Speech Recognition**


###  **Step 5: Speak and Transcribe**

###  **Notes:**

* This feature relies on your browser’s **speech recognition API** (best in Chrome).
* Accuracy depends on microphone quality, background noise, and speech clarity.
* Works best for **English** (other languages may vary).
